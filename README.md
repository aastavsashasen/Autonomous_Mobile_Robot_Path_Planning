# Autonomous_Mobile_Robot_Path_Planning
Application and Comparison of Potential Fields (PF), Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) and Rapidly Expanding Random Trees (RRT) for mobile robot path planning

All algorithms are evaluated with the same environment, with the robot’s controller for the PRM and RRT algorithms being the same, and differing for the PF algorithm. The environment is given as a Gridworld map of size 10X10 (m) and resolution 0.1 (m). Note that this environment includes obstacles. For all 3 of the problems, the following system assumptions were made:
1) The robot is a non-holonomic robot with 2 inputs (forward velocity, angular velocity) and 3 states (x position, y position, heading angle).
No slippage occurs between the robot’s wheels and the ground.
2) The time-step (dt) is infinitesimally small such that the simulation approaches the real world scenario, ie) model is sufficiently discretized (by Euler Discretization). This time-step is taken as 0.1 (s) for all simulations.
3) No motion model uncertainty exists, meaning there is no modeling of noise in the robot’s motion model.
4) Similarly, no measurement model uncertainty exists. The measurements are considered to be exactly equal to the robot’s state as well as all obstacle boundaries.
5) Markov chain assumption, meaning that the next state is only dependent on the previous state and the input.
6) The baseline of the robot is taken to be 0.45 (m) in all problems.
7) The robot is considered as a point object on the gridworld map.

## Potential Fields ##

In the PF algorithm, two kinds of potential fields are generated and summed to form a final potential field which allows the robot to navigate to its goal while avoiding obstacles. These are:
1) Attractive potential field: allows the robot to head in the direction of its goal
2) Repulsive potential field: allows the robot to avoid obstacles

In this resulting potential field, the robot moves in the direction of the anti-gradient in order to reach the lowest potential which is representative of the goal state. Note that general details surrounding the theory and formulation of the PF algorithm (not specific to this problem) are not included here (prior knowledge assumed). This is the case for all of the following algorithms. Only details specific to the implementation are provided.

Note that in the plot above, the black points represent the obstacles, the yellow points represent the detected obstacle boundaries and the blue point indicate the space of allowed motion of the robot with a reducing dot size closer to obstacle boundaries. The start (green) and end (red) points of the path are also included.

The Potential Fields algorithm varies in its means of implementation and hyperparameter tuning with the goal of generating an optimal final robot trajectory for this problem. The tuning details are as follows:
1) The hyperparameter tuning for the algorithm is notoriously tricky. To avoid arbitrarily making uninformed tuning adjustments, a combination of the attractor and repeller function to form the final potential field is plotted on a surface (Figure 2). By tuning the following parameters a smooth and close to ideal resulting potential field was generated by visual confirmation. The tuning parameters involved are as follows:
a) Attractor function: The gain of the pythagorean distance between the initial and goal positions. This gain is taken as a value of 10.0. The resulting attractor field equation is:

b) Repulsive function: The gain of function in this case is taken as 2.0. The marginal distance between a point and the closest obstacle is taken as 2.0 (m). This means that the robot must be within this distance from an obstacle for it to be affected by the repulsive force of that obstacle. Finally, for the visual consistency of the surface plot, the maximum repulsive force generated is taken as 300.0. This occurs upon collision with an obstacle. The resulting repulsive function is as follows (here ‘distance’ refers to the calculated distance between the point in question and the closest point on an obstacle):

c) The anti-gradient function: this is required to calculate the desired controller inputs for the robot to descend in the  evaluated potential surface and thus approach the goal without collisions. The gain here is taken as 1.0. The anti-gradient is calculated mathematically through an explicit equation rather than evaluated numerically over the resulting potential field. This results in the following gradient:

The negative of this function determines the vector input to the controller which determines the controller outputs.

The procedure for the implementation of the PF algorithm are as follows:
1) The algorithm is successfully completed if the robot trajectory reaches the goal position within a tolerance of 0.1 (m). The algorithm is considered to fail upon exceeding a simulation time of 100 (s), which corresponds to 1000 simulated time steps.
2) For each time step the anti-gradient of the potential function is evaluated and this is used to evaluate the outputs of the controller. These outputs are propagated through the motion model and this process is repeated in loop.
3) The controller itself has a constant forward velocity input of 1.0 (m/s). The angular velocity input is proportional to the difference between the robot’s heading and the anti-gradient vector(s) with a gain of 1.5 (chosen arbitrarily through trial and error). 

This procedure results in the final robot path shown below in Figure 3. The goal is indicated as the red point. The path of the robot is indicated as the consecutive blue points. The anti-gradient(s) are indicated as the black quivers and the obstacles and detected obstacle boundaries are indicated as the black and yellow points respectively.

As can be seen from the final trajectory of the robot, it successfully reaches the goal state without any collisions with obstacles. However, it can be noted that the continuously ‘swerving’ path of the robot is indicative of the minimum distance from the closest object to consider its repulsive force (set to 2.0 (m) here) can be reduced to result in a smoother final trajectory.
